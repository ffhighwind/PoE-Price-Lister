▻ Overhauled/updated the uniques and divination cards sections.
▻ Added a tool for updating divination cards and unique values. This took 3-4 days of work... and it still needs tweaking.

3.2.6
▻ Lowered the visibility of nets even further. Another net has been removed from the Strict filters.
▻ Added Necromancy Net.

3.2.2
▻ Added Divination Card: The Iron Bard to all of the filters. Only the Very Strict filter got this in the last update.
▻ Added a blue border to most 83+ shaper/elder normal and magic items. They are still hidden but can be seen while holding ALT.

3.1.13
▻ Added Rebirth divination card.
▻ Maps are no longer hidden in the Strict filter.

3.1.12
▻ Removed the blue border from DropLevel 70+ low value items (Spiked Gloves, etc). I'm debating moving Crystal Belts here.
▻ Reduced the border brightness of Jewels, Belts, Rings, and Amulets.
▻ Increased the size of low currency in the Normal filter (not Mapping).
▻ Fixed the blue border for 3-link wands/sceptres. Reduced the highlight range to ilvl 7.

▻ Removed ilvl 60-83 Stygian Vises from the Strict filter.
▻ Removed the sound from rare jewels and Abyss jewels in yellow maps and above.

▻ Added more color customization to Shaper/Elder rares.

3.1.9
▻ Added purple coloring to Shaper/Elder rares.

▻ Reduced the size of magic jewels in maps. Now they match the Abyss Jewels.
▻ Fixed white maps in the Strict filter.
▻ Added the Very Strict filter but it currently shows all uniques like the Strict filter. The wiki is broken so I can't fix this yet.
▻ Fixed Prismatic Jewel coloring.

3.1.7
▻ Fixed Shaped map colors. DropLevel on Shaped maps acts differently than last patch. This is considered a bug by Neversink. FilterBlast currently shows incorrect coloring, but that may change in the future.

3.1.6
▻ Moved Elder/Shaper to a lower priority than highlighted rares.
▻ Removed the border from Elder/Shaper items. They already have +/* symbols so it's redundant.
▻ Changed the mapping filters. You should now see more maps. See "Filter Details" more information. The new map tab and Shaper/Elder randomization makes low tier maps worth picking up.

3.1.5
▻ Removed Stygian Vise from 70+ drop level bases. This was useless code.
▻ Added sceptres to the 3 link wands. Reduced the shown level range from 13 to 11.
▻ Reduced the size of magic jewels and magic Abyss jewels in maps. Abyss jewels are now treated like normal Jewels and hidden in higher maps.

3.1.4
▻ Increased level range for 3 link wands from 9 to 13. I never saw one.
▻ Reduced level range for normal items from 13 to 10.
▻ Removed the background color for Abyss Jewels again. I may give them a very subtle background color in the future.

3.1.2
▻ Added a slight grey background to Abyss Jewels.
▻ Changed the Shaper/Elder rare border color slightly.
▻ Fixed a few bugs in Shaper/Elder rare colors (ilvl 75+).

3.1.1
▻ Abyss Jewels are shown the same as the normal jewels. If they are valuable enough then I will change this.
▻ Added New Divination Cards: No Traces, The Realm, Left to Fate, The Ruthless Ceinture, The Blazing Fire, The Eye of the Dragon
▻ Updated 72+ section (Crystal Belts, etc) to 70+. This may result in some 71-72 drop level items being shown that are not supposed to be.
▻ Changed maps in the Very Strict filter to be the same as the Strict filter. There's too many changes to the atlas to know what to hide.
▻ Added Stygian Vise belt base type. I'm assuming this is drop level 70+ and valuable. If it isn't then it will be detected as a normal low value belt.
▻ Added a purple border to Elder/Shaper rares, but I may need to brighten it. These have a higher filter priority than other rares. I don't think I am going to highlight normal/magic Shaper/Elder items because it adds too much code.

----------------------------------------------------------------
| Harbinger

3.0.13
▻ Removed ilvl 6+ 1-2 Socket normal/magic items. Starting from Ledge you will see a lot less normal/magic items. This is to help with item spam, especially while doing prophecies at high level.
▻ Added magic RGB items while leveling to the normal filter.
▻ Added smaller normal RGB items to low level maps in the normal filter.
▻ Removed the white border from quality chisel recipe items.

3.0.12

▻ Fixed a recent bug in the normal filter where whetstones were hidden.

3.0.11
▻ Fixed a bug in the Strict filters related to 72+ rares. This was an optional filter so the odds are nobody experienced the bug.

3.0.10
▻ Removed nearly worthless currency from the strict filter again (whetsones, transmutes). I ran Beachhead with a full party today and there was too much clutter.
▻ Removed most 83+ rares from the Very Strict Filter.
▻ Added <1c divination cards back into the Very Strict filter but removed sound.
▻ Changed value of divination cards: The Cataclysm, The Formless Sea, The King's Heart, The Lich
▻ Fixed a minor Divination Card bug: The Wolf vs The Wolf's Shadow

3.0.9
▻ Changed the border of 72+ armor and 73+ weapons to be toggled instead of always on. You can now enable it to highlight specific item classes that you're looking for. This should help solo self-found players a lot. I'm personally using this to search for one-handed axes. The feature has been implemented in the strict filters as well.
▻ Decreased the border brightness of 72+ rares, slightly.
▻ I am not adding positional sounds. The sound gets quieter when an item drops further away which is the exact opposite of what you want.
▻ Reduced the volume of most drops by 50% to compensate for the low Shaper Voice sounds. You may need to turn up the filter volume in the options menu.

3.0.8
▻ Removed the border from some 3-4 link normal/magic items.

3.0.7
▻ Changed uniques: Varnished Coat, Sorcerer Gloves
▻ Greatly reduced the background of most hidden normal/magic items.

▻ Fixed a small bug related to 6 socket uniques being colored incorrectly.

3.0.6

▻ Updated uniques: Abyssal Axe, Amethyst Ring, Auric Mace, Close Helmet, Despot Axe, Eternal Sword, Exquisite Leather, Great Mallet, Hubris Circlet, Imperial Claw, Legion Sword, Opal Wand, Tornado Wand, Vaal Hatchet, Vanguard Belt, War Sword

▻ Some of the uniques are highlighted as a lower price than their actual value.
▻ Removed leather belts from chance bases in normal filter.
▻ Removed Two-Toned Boots from the crafting bases.
▻ Adjusted league currency values.
New Values

3.0.5
▻ Increased the size/value of some very low tier currencies. Transmutation/Alteration shards are intentionally not being shown. Hold ALT to pick these up as they are only worth picking up while leveling.
▻ Removed some level ranges for leveling normal/magic accessories (now 15 for highlights, 30 for hidden).
▻ Confirmed that the new sounds work properly but are quieter than other sounds.

3.0.4

2.6.50
▻ Added more color themes.
▻ Added sound themes.

2.6.49
▻ Added Filtration Theme support.
▻ A few colors were adjusted to reduce the total number of themes.
▻ Changed all 235 opacity backgrounds to 230.

2.6.48
▻ Brightened the tan text of low value currency slightly. This makes it more legible.
▻ Added a background color to Perandus Coins and low Essences. This seems far better than a border.
▻ Reduced the size of 3-4L normal/magic items. Reduced the blue border brightness of 3-4L items including rares.

2.6.47
▻ Fixed a small bug related to magic 84+ Unset Rings.

▻ Added a slight border to Perandus Coins and Wailing/Weeping Essences.
▻ Added block switches to the pre-filter (first pass on equipment).
▻ Added New Uniques to the filter. Speaker's Wreath and Ahn's Might are bad. These are currently listed as 2-10c, so this may be reduced later. Tinkerskin and Soul Tether are potentially useful so they're listed at 1-2c.

2.6.44
▻ Added some more one-handers to the valuable list since Sunder seems like it will be somewhat popular.
▻ Added more semi-valuable rares to the Strict Filter but not the Very Strict.

2.6.43
▻ Removed most of the useless 83+ crafting bases. You have to hold ALT to see most of these.

2.6.42
▻ Changed grey border to blue for 3-4L items.
▻ Added all 56+ DropLevel bases to rare weapons. This is to simplify the filter and reduce errors.
▻ Added some low drop level 5L bows to the strict filters. Low level bows are used by casters for SRS and Decay since they're easier color.
▻ Minor optimizations and comment updates.

2.6.41
▻ Massive overhaul of the filter.
▻ Rares and Crafting bases have undergone major changes. The border and background colors have been modified.
▻ Optimized the filter to run 2x as fast on equipment but ~25% slower on Uniques, Divination Cards, and Maps. This significantly reduces the load times with FilterBlast and should be better in game as well.
▻ Prepared the filter for 3.0 (Pantheon Souls). This just needs to be uncommented to work.
▻ Added a light blue border to Crafting bases.
▻ Increased the brightness of 3-4 link low level items.
▻ Changed low value Divination Cards slightly.

2.6.40
▻ Changed the opacity/brightness to some divination cards and maps.

2.6.38
▻ Fixed a recent bug that was preventing most rare accessories from appearing.
▻ Changed the sound of Misc Map Items and Breachstones.
▻ Edited some comments.

2.6.37
▻ Modified the Misc Map Items to be more blue instead of purple. It was too similar to currency (pink).

2.6.36
▻ Added a slight border to low level 4-links.
▻ Reduced the border brightness of quality chisels and non-utility flasks.
▻ Removed 3-4 link ilvl 20+ white/blue weapons. 
▻ Changed the colors for Misc Map Items (Breachstones/Reliquary Keys) from green to purple. I'm considering adjusting this color slightly.

2.6.34

2.6.31
▻ Changed T16 maps (Guardians) to red with grey text/border.
▻ Added a slight green background to quest/labyrinth items.
▻ Updated some comments.

2.6.30
▻ More tweaks to rare 60+/83+ one-handers.

2.6.29
▻ Removed the border around ilvl 83+ rare one-handers except top-tier wands/daggers.
▻ Removed claws and most swords from the ilvl 77+ top tier bases. Wands/daggers are still the best bases for profit since they're mostly used by casters and uniques don't compete enough with rares. Claws have too much competition with uniques so they're not worth IDing. Swords don't have as much competition but they're incredibly hard to roll well and aren't as widely used, so I left only Jewelled Foils and Corsair Swords.

2.6.28
▻ Reduced the number of shown ilvl 60-70 daggers/wands again.
▻ Reduced the size of 60+ top tier one-handers.
▻ Increased the size of 77+ top tier one-handers+. I don't do this to most two-handers because it's better to craft them from a 5-6L base. I left out one-handed maces/axes since most people use uniques instead of crafting those bases.
▻ Reduced the size of 75+ and 83+ top tier weapons (Harbinger, Daggers, Wands, etc).
▻ Added a few more top tier one-handers to the list (Foils, Claws, etc).

2.6.27
▻ Reduced the number of shown ilvl 60+ rare shields, wands, and daggers from the normal filter. Greatly reduced the shown ilvl 70+ of these. Physical daggers got demolished this patch in favor of claws.

2.6.26
▻ Added Marble Amulet to the expensive crafting jewelry bases (and the strict filters). Righteous Fire has become popular.
▻ Removed Two-Toned boots from the strict filters. I've seen them way too much and they're worthless since Labyrinth enchants are better and will overwrite the implicit.
▻ Reduced the sound of low value ilvl <67 uniques in the Very Strict filter.

2.6.25
▻ Added more uniques to useful list: Auric Mace, Carnal Armour, Ezomyte Blade, Hellion's Paw, Ironscale Boots, Spidersilk Robe, Strapped Leather, Sulphur Flask, Wild Leather.

2.6.24
▻ Added sound for low level jewels to the strict filter.
▻ Reduced the size of most 83+ ilvl rares. The top tier bases are still very large. I used to make armor larger than weapons but I gave them different text color instead.

2.6.23
▻ Removed most quiver bases from the filter and reduced the size of the remaining ones. I should have done this a long time ago. They're not valuable and most people use the uniques anyway.

2.6.22
▻ Standardized the light grey colors.
▻ Removed transparency from borders.
▻ Added a background color to unique jewels to match other uniques.
▻ Added Item Quantity to valuable gems list. It doesn't drop anymore, but I figured I should add it just in case (legacy relic).
▻ Added sound back to 6S 5L in the very strict filter. I missed this earlier.
▻ Added a grey background to 4L low level items.
▻ Reduced the border color of most ilvl 83+ rares and increased it for top tier rares. These were too bright and looked more valuable than they are.
▻ Attempted to filter Relics (Legacy Uniques). They cannot be hidden in the filter and are being detected as Uniques instead of Relics. I decided not to add special rules to the filter for these items.

2.6.21
▻ Added sound back to 6 socket items in the very strict filter.
▻ Reduced border color brightness of low value uniques. They're not valuable and bright border made me always want to pick them up.

▻ Gems have been modified slightly. 
▻ Some drop-only Vaal gems have been removed from the strict filters.
▻ Valuable gems now have slightly lighter text.

2.6.19
▻ Uniques have been reordered from most expensive to least just like Divination Cards for the same exact reason. This is to preempt future bugs and prevent valuable items from being hidden.

▻ Divination Cards have been partially updated. They have been organized alphabetically. Other changes are listed below.
(10c+) The Celestial Justicar, The Vast, Pride Before the Fall
(1c+) The Standoff, The Chains that Bind, The Avenger, Merciless Armament
▻ A major bug related to Divination Cards has been fixed. A couple cards were being hidden or mislabeled due to name conflicts. The cards have been ordered from most expensive first to ensure that they'll never be hidden again. (Hope, Glimmer of Hope, Last Hope) (The Dragon, The Dragon's Heart)
▻ NOTE: Some cards are worth a small amount in hardcore but I'm not going to add them to the strict filters because they're not worth enough (The Twins, Grave Knowledge, Might is Right, etc).

▻ Minor fixes.

▻ Removed T1-4 maps while in T8+ maps.
▻ Added 72+ Titanium Spirit Shields to the Strict filters.

2.6.8
▻ Added the white border to all Leaguestones. You can combine leaguestones so you might as well pick them all up.
▻ Added Divination Card: The Spoiled Prince
▻ Added Currency: Stacked Deck, Unshaping Orb, Cartographer's Seals
▻ Imprint (Eternal Orb result) has been left as an error intentionally since they pretty much don't exist anymore.

2.6.7
▻ Removed the chance bases from Strict Filter.
▻ Reduced size and removed background color for Breach Rings. This makes them slightly easier to ignore since they're worthless.
▻ Removed Breach Rings from maps in Strict Filter (68+).

▻ Made top tier weapon bases more consistent: Harbinger Bow, Platinum Kris, Imperial Skean, Ambusher, Imbued Wand, Tornado Wand.
▻ Removed rare Astral Plates from the Strict filter. They're not valuable.

2.6.6
▻ Added divination card Scarred Meadow. Accidentally removed this at some point.
▻ Removed magic jewels from all maps (ilvl 68+) in strict filter.
▻ Removed magic jewels from yellow/red maps in normal filter. The new vivid jewel divination cards kind of ruin the point of these (Shard of Fate, The Endurance).
▻ Added droplevel 41+ gloves/boots/helmets to normal filter. Previously this was droplevel 50+. I was having a hard time completing Chaos/Regal recipes fast enough.

2.6.5
▻ Fixed a typo that broke the strict filter.
▻ Added a new tier of Divination cards. Worthless has been split into a "Nearly Worthless" and "Worthless" categories. No cards were hidden in the normal filter but now the really bad ones are.

2.5.10
▻ Added Filtration support. You can now tweak the filter using Filtration and FilterBLAST.
▻ Added a bunch of SmartBlocks so that users can enable/disable certain filter features. However, this might result in some weird behavior so I recommend only modifying colors/sizes.
▻ Reduced the size of error items from 45 to 40. It's more likely that error items are worthless and if they're too big then they'll be extremely distracting.

▻ Modified opacity of Divination cards so that different values can be more easily distinguished.

2.5.8
▻ Increased accuracy of colors for certain hidden items.
▻ Fixed some of the chance/crafting bases. Ilvl 83+ Wands/daggers/harbingers were popping up everywhere so I made them hidden again in the normal filter. If you want to find these crafting bases then you should tap ALT once in a while to look for them.
▻ Reduced the size of some gems.

2.5.7
▻ Huge update to the filter. I have fixed most of the bugs resulting from this but there may be more.

▻ Added Breach Blessings and Breachstones to filter. They were already shown but now they're more visible.

▻ Removed the border of rares under ilvl 83/84.
▻ Removed non-quality Vaal Reave from gem sounds.

There were too many pointless font sizes.
▻ Added Crystal Belt to crafting bases.
▻ All 83+ crafting base blues/whites are now hidden. They can be seen while holding ALT, and are still larger and easily distinguished.
